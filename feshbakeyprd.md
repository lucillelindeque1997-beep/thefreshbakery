Key Features and User StoriesFeature CategoryUser StoryRequirementCase Study ListingAs a potential client, I need a clear landing page to quickly browse all available projects and see their associated industries/focus areas.Dedicated "Projects" landing page with cards for each case study (e.g., Fresh Start Bakery Chain). Each card must display the project Title, Industry (e.g., Retail/F&B), and Primary Focus (e.g., Digital Transformation).Case Study ViewAs a hiring manager, I need to easily jump to the Results section of any case study to assess the impact immediately.Each case study page must use anchor links (a table of contents) to allow users to navigate instantly to sections like I. Context, II. Findings, III. Solution, IV. Projected Results/Impact, and V. Key Deliverables.Presentation StyleAs a busy executive, I need the case study to feel like a high-quality, focused, and printable final report, not a dynamic web page.The site must adopt a Document/Presentation Aesthetic, utilizing a fixed-width, centered container (max-width 800px) and professional typography to emulate a PDF or slide deck.PDF Download FunctionalityAs a stakeholder, I want to download individual case studies as professional PDF documents for offline review and sharing.Each case study must include a prominent "Download PDF" button that generates a professionally formatted document containing all sections including visual deliverables.Responsive DesignAs a user viewing on a mobile device, I need the case studies to be perfectly legible and navigable without horizontal scrolling.The design must respect the document aesthetic while remaining fully responsive, scaling the fixed container to w-full on mobile for optimal legibility.4. Content RequirementsAll case studies must adhere to the five-pillar structure demonstrated in the Fresh Start Bakery Chain project:Context and Dual Challenge: Concise problem statement.Diagnostic Approach and Key Findings: Methods used (e.g., SWOT, Benchmarking) and the resulting root cause analysis.Strategic Recommendations and Solution Architecture: The concrete, justified action plan.Projected Results and Impact (ROI): Quantifiable metrics and expected returns.Key Deliverables and Visual Assets: Concrete outputs including wireframes, charts, system diagrams, financial models, and implementation tools that demonstrate tangible project outcomes.Content Focus: All body content must use clear headings and strong typography to ensure readability and professional presentation.
